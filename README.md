# Deep-Learning-for-Object-Recognition
 In this project, I evaluated the performance of two different types of neural networks, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset. The main goal was to determine which model performs better in terms of accuracy for face recognition tasks.
